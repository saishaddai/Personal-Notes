Data Structure (quick notes)
================

Data structures are fundamental building blocks in computer science that organize and store data in a specific way to optimize performance, efficiency, and accessibility. As a professional-level student, understanding data structures is crucial for designing and implementing complex algorithms, as well as for understanding the underlying principles of computer systems.

**Key Concepts**
-----------------

* Arrays
* Linked Lists
* Stacks
* Queues
* Trees
* Graphs
* Hash Tables
* Heaps


**Arrays**
-----------------

* Ordered collection of elements of the same data type
* Accessed by index, with constant-time access to any element
* Useful for storing and manipulating large amounts of data
* Limitations: fixed size, inefficient for insertions and deletions



**Linked Lists**
-----------------

* Collection of nodes, each containing data and a reference to the next node
* Flexible size, efficient for insertions and deletions
* Traversal is linear, with time complexity of O(n)
* Types: singly linked, doubly linked, circular linked lists



**Stacks**
-----------------

* Last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure
* Useful for managing function calls, expression evaluation, and backtracking algorithms
* Operations: push, pop, peek, isEmpty
* Time complexity: push and pop are O(1)



**Queues**
-----------------

* First-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure
* Useful for managing processes, event handling, and breadth-first search algorithms
* Operations: enqueue, dequeue, peek, isEmpty
* Time complexity: enqueue and dequeue are O(1)




**Trees**
-----------------

* Hierarchical data structure with a root node and child nodes
* Useful for representing hierarchical relationships, file systems, and decision-making algorithms
* Types: binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, red-black trees, B-trees
* Traversal methods: in-order, pre-order, post-order, level-order
* Time complexity: depends on the specific tree implementation




**Graphs**
-----------------

* Collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges
* Useful for modeling relationships, social networks, transportation systems, and pathfinding algorithms
* Types: directed, undirected, weighted, unweighted
* Traversal methods: depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS)
* Time complexity: depends on the graph representation and the algorithm used

**Hash Tables**
-----------------
* Data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to their corresponding values
* Provides constant-time average-case access to elements
* Useful for implementing dictionaries, caches, and symbol tables
* Collision handling: chaining, open addressing (linear probing, quadratic probing, double hashing)

**Heaps**
-----------------
* Tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: the value of each node is greater than or equal to (or less than or equal to) the values of its children
* Useful for implementing priority queues, sorting algorithms, and graph algorithms
* Types: min-heap, max-heap
* Operations: insert, extract-min/max, heapify
* Time complexity: insert and extract-min/max are O(log n)
