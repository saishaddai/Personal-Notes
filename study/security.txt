Security Fundamentals
Confidentiality: Protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access.
Integrity: Ensuring data is not modified without authorization.
Availability: Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed.
2. Common Security Threats
SQL Injection: Injecting malicious SQL code to access or modify sensitive data.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Injecting malicious JavaScript code into websites to steal user data.
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Tricking users into performing unintended actions on a web application.
Buffer Overflow: Overwriting memory to execute malicious code.
Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS): Overwhelming systems with traffic to make them unavailable.
3. Secure Coding Practices
Input Validation: Verifying user input to prevent malicious data from entering the system.
Output Encoding: Encoding data to prevent XSS attacks.
Error Handling: Handling errors securely to prevent information disclosure.
Secure Password Storage: Storing passwords securely using hashing and salting.
Secure Communication: Using HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
4. Authentication and Authorization
Authentication: Verifying the identity of users or systems.
Authorization: Controlling access to resources based on user identity or role.
Session Management: Managing user sessions securely to prevent unauthorized access.
5. Secure Data Storage
Encryption: Protecting data at rest using encryption algorithms.
Access Control: Controlling access to sensitive data based on user identity or role.
Data Backup and Recovery: Ensuring data is backed up and can be recovered in case of a security incident.
6. Common Security Frameworks and Tools
OWASP: A non-profit organization providing resources and tools for web application security.
SSL/TLS: A protocol for secure communication over the internet.
HTTPS: A protocol for secure communication over the web.
Hashing and Salting: Techniques for secure password storage.
7. Secure Development Lifecycle
Secure Requirements: Incorporating security requirements into the development process.
Secure Design: Designing systems with security in mind.
Secure Implementation: Implementing security measures during development.
Secure Testing: Testing for security vulnerabilities during development.
Secure Deployment: Deploying systems securely to prevent unauthorized access.
8. Common Security Certifications
CompTIA Security+: A certification for IT security professionals.
CISSP: A certification for information security professionals.
CEH: A certification for ethical hackers.
9. Security Best Practices
Keep Software Up-to-Date: Keeping software up-to-date to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
Use Strong Passwords: Using strong passwords to prevent unauthorized access.
Use Two-Factor Authentication: Using two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security.
Monitor Systems: Monitoring systems for security incidents and responding quickly.
10. Security Resources
OWASP: A non-profit organization providing resources and tools for web application security.
SANS Institute: A organization providing security training and resources.
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA): A US government agency providing security resources and guidance.
