Software Design Principles
SOLID Principles:
S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - A class should have one reason to change.
O: Open/Closed Principle (OCP) - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
2. Design Patterns
Creational Patterns:

Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.
Factory Method: Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
Abstract Factory: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
Structural Patterns:

Adapter: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
Decorator: Adds new functionality to an object dynamically.
Facade: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
Behavioral Patterns:

Observer: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
Strategy: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Command: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
3. Coupling and Cohesion
Coupling: Refers to the degree of interdependence between software modules.

Loose Coupling: Modules are independent; changes in one module do not affect others.
Tight Coupling: Modules are highly dependent on each other.
Cohesion: Refers to how closely related and focused the responsibilities of a single module are.

High Cohesion: A module has a single, well-defined responsibility.
Low Cohesion: A module performs a wide variety of tasks that are not closely related.
4. Architectural Patterns
Layered Architecture: Organizes code into layers (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access) to separate concerns.
Microservices: Structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, each responsible for a specific business capability.
Event-Driven Architecture: Uses events to trigger and communicate between decoupled services.
5. Testing and Quality Assurance
Unit Testing: Tests individual components for correctness.
Integration Testing: Tests the interaction between integrated components.
Test-Driven Development (TDD): A development approach where tests are written before the code itself.
6. Documentation and Communication
UML Diagrams: Use Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams (e.g., class diagrams, sequence diagrams) to visualize system architecture and design.
Code Comments: Write clear comments to explain complex logic and design decisions.
7. Best Practices
Code Reviews: Regularly review code to ensure quality and adherence to design principles.
Refactoring: Continuously improve the codebase by restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior.
Version Control: Use version control systems (e.g., Git) to manage changes and collaborate effectively.
