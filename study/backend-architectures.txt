1. Layered Architecture
Description: Organizes the application into layers, each with a specific responsibility (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access).
Layers:
Presentation Layer: Handles user interactions (e.g., REST controllers).
Service Layer: Contains business logic and application rules.
Data Access Layer: Manages data persistence (e.g., repositories).
Use Case: Suitable for traditional web applications and enterprise applications.
2. Microservices Architecture
Description: Structures an application as a collection of small, loosely coupled services, each responsible for a specific business capability.
Characteristics:
Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
Services communicate over lightweight protocols (e.g., HTTP/REST, gRPC).
Use Case: Ideal for large, complex applications that require scalability and flexibility.
3. Event-Driven Architecture
Description: Uses events to trigger and communicate between decoupled services or components.
Components:
Event Producers: Generate events based on state changes.
Event Consumers: Listen for and react to events.
Event Bus: Facilitates communication between producers and consumers (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
Use Case: Suitable for applications requiring real-time processing and responsiveness.
4. Serverless Architecture
Description: Allows developers to build and run applications without managing server infrastructure. Functions are executed in response to events.
Characteristics:
Pay-as-you-go pricing model.
Automatic scaling and high availability.
Use Case: Ideal for applications with variable workloads or for rapid prototyping.
5. Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)
Description: Emphasizes the separation of the core application logic from external systems through ports and adapters.
Components:
Core Logic: Contains business rules and domain logic.
Ports: Define interfaces for interaction with external systems.
Adapters: Implement the ports to connect to external systems (e.g., databases, APIs).
Use Case: Suitable for applications that require high testability and maintainability.
6. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
Description: Focuses on modeling the domain and its complexities, emphasizing collaboration between technical and domain experts.
Components:
Entities: Objects with a distinct identity.
Value Objects: Immutable objects that represent descriptive aspects of the domain.
Aggregates: Clusters of related entities treated as a single unit.
Use Case: Ideal for complex domains where business logic is central to the application.
7. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
Description: Similar to microservices but typically involves larger, more monolithic services that communicate over a network.
Characteristics:
Services are designed to be reusable and interoperable.
Often uses an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) for communication.
Use Case: Suitable for enterprise applications that require integration of various services.
